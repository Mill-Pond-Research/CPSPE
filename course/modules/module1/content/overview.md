# Module 1: Foundations of Contextual Understanding

## 1. Introduction to Contextual Problem-Solving Prompt Engineering (CPSPE)

### 1.1 What is CPSPE?

#### Definition and Scope
Contextual Problem-Solving Prompt Engineering (CPSPE) is a systematic framework for designing, crafting, and optimizing prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) that emphasizes the critical role of context in achieving optimal outcomes. This methodology goes beyond simple prompt construction to encompass a holistic understanding of the problem space, stakeholder needs, and environmental factors that influence AI-driven solutions.
