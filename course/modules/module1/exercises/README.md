# Module 1 Exercises: Foundations of Contextual Understanding

This directory contains practical exercises to help you master the fundamental concepts of CPSPE.

## Exercise 1: Context Identification
**Duration: 30 minutes**

Analyze the following scenarios and identify the key contextual elements that would influence your prompt engineering approach:

1. A customer service chatbot for a global e-commerce platform
2. A code documentation assistant for a development team
3. A medical symptom analysis system

For each scenario:
- List all relevant contextual factors
- Rank them by importance
- Explain why each factor matters
- Identify potential contextual conflicts

## Exercise 2: Problem Decomposition
**Duration: 45 minutes**

Take a complex prompt engineering challenge and break it down using CPSPE principles:

Challenge: "Create a system that helps teachers generate personalized feedback for student essays"

Tasks:
1. Identify the main components of the problem
2. Map out the relationships between components
3. List the contextual considerations for each component
4. Create a hierarchical breakdown of the solution approach

## Exercise 3: Basic Prompt Crafting
**Duration: 45 minutes**

Practice creating context-aware prompts for the following situations:

1. Summarizing technical documentation for different audience levels
2. Translating content while preserving cultural context
3. Generating code comments for different programming paradigms

Requirements:
- Write 3 different prompts for each situation
- Explain how each prompt addresses specific contextual elements
- Test the prompts and document the results
- Iterate based on the outcomes

## Exercise 4: Context Mapping
**Duration: 1 hour**

Create a comprehensive context map for a real-world prompt engineering challenge:

1. Choose one of the provided case studies
2. Use the context mapping template (see resources)
3. Identify and document:
   - Primary stakeholders
   - Environmental factors
   - Technical constraints
   - Success criteria
   - Potential risks
4. Present your context map and explain your reasoning
