# Module 1 Homework: Foundations of CPSPE

## Overview
This homework assignment will help you apply the fundamental concepts of CPSPE to real-world scenarios.

## Assignment 1: Context Analysis (30 points)
Analyze a real-world AI application of your choice (e.g., chatbot, content generator, code assistant) and:

1. Identify all relevant contexts:
   - User context
   - Technical context
   - Business context
   - Cultural context
   - Environmental context

2. For each context:
   - Explain its importance
   - Describe potential challenges
   - Suggest mitigation strategies
   - Document dependencies

3. Create a context map using the provided template

## Assignment 2: Problem Decomposition (30 points)
Choose one of the following scenarios:

1. A multilingual customer service chatbot
2. An AI-powered code review assistant
3. A content personalization system

Tasks:
1. Break down the problem into components
2. Identify relationships between components
3. Create a solution hierarchy
4. Document assumptions and constraints
5. Propose validation methods

## Assignment 3: Initial Implementation (40 points)
Design a basic CPSPE solution for a simple use case:

1. Select a specific problem domain
2. Apply the CPSPE framework:
   - Context analysis
   - Problem decomposition
   - Solution design
   - Implementation plan

3. Create:
   - Context-aware prompts
   - Validation tests
   - Performance metrics
   - Documentation
