# Complex Systems Analysis Guide for CPSPE

## Purpose
This guide provides frameworks and tools for analyzing complex systems and wicked problems in the context of prompt engineering.

## 1. System Analysis Framework

### System Boundary Definition
```
Component Type | Internal Elements | External Elements | Interface Points
--------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------
Technical     | [List elements]  | [List elements]   | [List points]
Social        | [List elements]  | [List elements]   | [List points]
Environmental | [List elements]  | [List elements]   | [List points]
```

### Relationship Mapping
```
Element A | Element B | Relationship Type | Strength | Direction
----------|-----------|------------------|-----------|----------
[Name]    | [Name]    | [Type]          | [1-5]    | [→,←,↔]
```

## 2. Complex System Characteristics

### Emergent Properties Analysis
```
Property        | Description | Contributing Factors | Detection Methods
----------------|------------|---------------------|------------------
[Property name] | [Details]  | [List factors]      | [List methods]
```

### Feedback Loop Identification
```
Loop Name | Components | Type      | Impact | Time Delay
----------|------------|-----------|--------|------------
[Name]    | [List]     | [+/-]    | [1-5]  | [Duration]
```

## 3. Wicked Problem Analysis

### Problem Framing Template
```
Aspect          | Description
----------------|------------
Core Challenge  | [Describe]
Stakeholders    | [List]
Constraints     | [List]
Dependencies    | [List]
Uncertainties   | [List]
```

### Solution Space Mapping
```
Approach     | Benefits | Drawbacks | Stakeholder Impact
-------------|----------|-----------|------------------
[Approach 1] | [List]   | [List]    | [Description]
[Approach 2] | [List]   | [List]    | [Description]
```

## 4. Analysis Tools

### Causal Loop Diagrams
```
Element → Element → Element
   ↑                  ↓
   ←  ←  Element  ←  ←
```

### System Archetypes
1. Limits to Growth
2. Shifting the Burden
3. Tragedy of the Commons
4. Success to the Successful
5. Fixes that Fail

### Stock and Flow Models
```
Stock 1 → Flow → Stock 2
   ↑              ↓
Inflow         Outflow
```

## 5. Implementation Strategies

### Phased Approach
```
Phase | Focus Areas | Deliverables | Success Criteria
------|-------------|-------------|------------------
1     | [List]      | [List]      | [List]
2     | [List]      | [List]      | [List]
3     | [List]      | [List]      | [List]
```

### Intervention Points
```
Point          | Leverage | Risk | Implementation Complexity
---------------|----------|------|------------------------
[Location]     | [1-5]    | [1-5]| [1-5]
```

## 6. Monitoring and Adaptation

### Performance Metrics
```
Metric         | Description | Target | Measurement Method
---------------|------------|--------|-------------------
[Metric name]  | [Details]  | [Goal] | [Method]
```

### Adaptation Triggers
```
Trigger        | Threshold | Response Action | Responsibility
---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------
[Condition]    | [Value]   | [Action]       | [Role]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. System Analysis
- Start with clear boundaries
- Map all significant relationships
- Document assumptions
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Track emergent properties

### 2. Problem Solving
- Use iterative approaches
- Maintain flexibility
- Document decision rationale
- Consider long-term impacts
- Plan for adaptation

### 3. Implementation
- Start small and scale
- Monitor continuously
- Adapt as needed
- Document learning
- Share insights

## Common Pitfalls

1. Oversimplification
   - Missing key relationships
   - Ignoring time delays
   - Overlooking feedback loops

2. Analysis Paralysis
   - Too much detail
   - Perfectionism
   - Delayed action

3. Implementation Issues
   - Rigid planning
   - Poor monitoring
   - Delayed adaptation

## Notes
- Adapt frameworks to specific contexts
- Document all assumptions
- Regular review and updates
- Share learnings with team
