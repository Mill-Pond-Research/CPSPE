# Problem Decomposition Worksheet

## Purpose
This worksheet guides you through the process of breaking down complex prompt engineering challenges into manageable components using the CPSPE framework.

## Problem Analysis Template

### 1. Core Problem Identification
```
Primary Challenge: [Describe the main problem]
Symptoms vs. Root Causes:
- Observed Symptoms: [List visible issues]
- Potential Root Causes: [List underlying causes]
- Evidence: [Document supporting data]

5 Whys Analysis:
1. Why? [Initial problem statement]
2. Why? [Deeper cause]
3. Why? [Further cause]
4. Why? [Underlying factor]
5. Why? [Root cause]
```

### 2. Sub-Problem Segmentation
```
Component Breakdown:
1. [Sub-problem 1]
   - Dependencies: [List]
   - Constraints: [List]
   - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

2. [Sub-problem 2]
   - Dependencies: [List]
   - Constraints: [List]
   - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

[Continue as needed]

Relationships Map:
[Draw or describe connections between sub-problems]
```

### 3. Constraint Analysis
```
Technical Constraints:
- [List technical limitations]

Resource Constraints:
- [List resource limitations]

Time Constraints:
- [List time limitations]

Other Constraints:
- [List additional constraints]
```

## Example: E-commerce Product Recommendation System

### 1. Core Problem Identification
```
Primary Challenge: Improve product recommendation accuracy

Symptoms vs. Root Causes:
- Symptoms: Low click-through rate, poor conversion
- Root Causes: Limited context understanding, narrow data usage
- Evidence: Analytics data showing pattern

5 Whys Analysis:
1. Why are recommendations not effective?
   → Low click-through rates
2. Why are click-through rates low?
   → Recommendations don't match user interests
3. Why don't they match interests?
   → Limited understanding of user context
4. Why is context understanding limited?
   → Insufficient data integration
5. Why is data integration insufficient?
   → Siloed data systems and limited context processing

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Problem Documentation
- Write clear problem statements
- Include all relevant context
- Document assumptions
- Note information gaps

### 2. Analysis Process
- Start with broad overview
- Drill down systematically
- Document relationships
- Validate with stakeholders

### 3. Solution Development
- Address root causes
- Consider dependencies
- Plan for constraints
- Design iterative approach

## Best Practices

1. Be systematic in analysis
2. Document all assumptions
3. Validate with stakeholders
4. Consider multiple perspectives
5. Review and refine regularly

## Notes
- Use this worksheet iteratively
- Update as new information emerges
- Share with team members
- Keep track of changes and decisions
