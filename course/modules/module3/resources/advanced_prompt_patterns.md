# Advanced Prompt Engineering Patterns

## Purpose
This guide provides templates and examples for advanced prompt engineering patterns, focusing on few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and role-playing approaches.

## 1. Few-Shot Learning Patterns

### Template Structure
```
[Context Setting]
[Example 1 Input] -> [Example 1 Output]
[Example 2 Input] -> [Example 2 Output]
[Example 3 Input] -> [Example 3 Output]
[Target Input] -> ?
```

### Example: Sentiment Analysis
```
Task: Analyze the sentiment of customer reviews.

Review: "The product arrived on time and works perfectly!" 
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "Delivery was delayed but product quality is good."
Sentiment: Mixed

Review: "Poor customer service and faulty product."
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "Works as advertised, great value for money."
Sentiment: ?
```

## 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

### Template Structure
```
[Problem Statement]
Let's solve this step by step:
1. [First logical step]
2. [Second logical step]
3. [Third logical step]
...
Therefore, [Conclusion]
```

### Example: Problem-Solving
```
Problem: Calculate the total cost of a shopping cart with 3 items at $20 each, 
with a 10% discount and 8% tax.

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Calculate base cost: 3 × $20 = $60
2. Apply discount: $60 × 0.90 = $54
3. Calculate tax: $54 × 0.08 = $4.32
4. Add tax to discounted price: $54 + $4.32 = $58.32

Therefore, the total cost is $58.32
```

## 3. Role-Playing Prompts

### Template Structure
```
Role: [Specific role or expertise]
Context: [Situation or background]
Task: [Specific objective]
Constraints: [Any limitations or requirements]
Format: [Expected output format]
```

### Example: Technical Expert
```
Role: Senior Software Architect
Context: You're reviewing a proposed system architecture
Task: Evaluate the design and provide recommendations
Constraints: Focus on scalability and security
Format: Provide a structured analysis with pros/cons and specific recommendations
```

## 4. Modular Prompt Design

### Component Structure
```
[Context Module]
[Instruction Module]
[Example Module]
[Format Module]
[Constraint Module]
```

### Example: Data Analysis
```
Context Module:
You are working with a large dataset of customer transactions.

Instruction Module:
Analyze the patterns and provide insights on customer behavior.

Example Module:
Example insight: "25% of customers make repeat purchases within 30 days"

Format Module:
Present findings in bullet points with supporting data.

Constraint Module:
Focus on actionable insights that can improve sales.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Few-Shot Learning
- Use diverse but relevant examples
- Maintain consistent format across examples
- Progress from simple to complex cases
- Include edge cases when relevant

### 2. Chain-of-Thought
- Break down complex problems clearly
- Show explicit reasoning steps
- Maintain logical flow
- Include intermediate calculations

### 3. Role-Playing
- Define roles clearly
- Provide relevant context
- Set clear objectives
- Specify output format

### 4. General Guidelines
- Test prompts with various inputs
- Iterate based on results
- Document successful patterns
- Share and reuse effective templates

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Overcomplicating prompts
2. Inconsistent formatting
3. Unclear instructions
4. Missing context
5. Ambiguous objectives

## Notes
- Adapt patterns to specific use cases
- Combine patterns when appropriate
- Document successful variations
- Share learnings with team
