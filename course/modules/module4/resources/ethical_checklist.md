# Ethical Considerations Checklist for Prompt Engineering

## Purpose
This checklist helps ensure that prompt engineering practices adhere to ethical principles and promote responsible AI development.

## 1. Bias Assessment

### Data and Training
- [ ] Reviewed training data for potential biases
- [ ] Assessed representation across different demographics
- [ ] Checked for historical biases in data
- [ ] Evaluated data collection methods
- [ ] Documented known data limitations

### Algorithm and Model
- [ ] Analyzed model outputs for systematic biases
- [ ] Tested with diverse input scenarios
- [ ] Evaluated fairness across different groups
- [ ] Documented model limitations
- [ ] Assessed potential discriminatory impacts

### Language and Culture
- [ ] Checked for culturally sensitive content
- [ ] Evaluated language inclusivity
- [ ] Assessed accessibility considerations
- [ ] Reviewed for regional appropriateness
- [ ] Documented language-specific limitations

## 2. Transparency and Accountability

### Documentation
- [ ] Clearly documented prompt design decisions
- [ ] Recorded testing methodologies
- [ ] Maintained version control of prompts
- [ ] Documented known limitations
- [ ] Created audit trail

### Explainability
- [ ] Can explain how the system makes decisions
- [ ] Provided clear user documentation
- [ ] Documented error handling procedures
- [ ] Explained system limitations
- [ ] Created user guidance materials

### Responsibility
- [ ] Assigned clear ownership of outcomes
- [ ] Established feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Created incident response plan
- [ ] Defined escalation procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring systems

## 3. Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact
```
Stakeholder Group | Potential Benefits | Potential Risks | Mitigation Strategies
-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------
Primary Users    | [List benefits]   | [List risks]    | [List strategies]
Secondary Users  | [List benefits]   | [List risks]    | [List strategies]
Society at Large | [List benefits]   | [List risks]    | [List strategies]
```

### Indirect Impact
- [ ] Assessed environmental impact
- [ ] Evaluated societal implications
- [ ] Considered economic effects
- [ ] Analyzed cultural impact
- [ ] Documented unintended consequences

## 4. Safety and Security

### Data Protection
- [ ] Implemented privacy safeguards
- [ ] Secured sensitive information
- [ ] Established data handling procedures
- [ ] Created data retention policies
- [ ] Set up access controls

### System Security
- [ ] Assessed vulnerability to attacks
- [ ] Implemented security measures
- [ ] Created incident response plans
- [ ] Established monitoring systems
- [ ] Documented security protocols

## 5. Continuous Monitoring

### Performance Tracking
```
Metric           | Current Value | Target | Action if Below Target
-----------------|--------------|--------|---------------------
Bias Score      | [Value]      | [Goal] | [Action plan]
Fairness Rating | [Value]      | [Goal] | [Action plan]
Safety Score    | [Value]      | [Goal] | [Action plan]
```

### Feedback Integration
- [ ] Established feedback collection
- [ ] Created response procedures
- [ ] Set up regular reviews
- [ ] Documented improvements
- [ ] Maintained feedback logs
